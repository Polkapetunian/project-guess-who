# Guess Who (dunnit)!

This project is a oneplayer digital version of the game Guess Who! We got starter files where the layout and design and some of the functionality were already there. The main goal was to practise array methods and manipulation of the DOM using Javascript. I wanted to give my version of the game a personal toach so I replaced all the images and the array of people in the game.

## The problem

First I concentrated on getting the game to work. I progressed on my own for a while and when I got stuck I reached out to fellow students, who helped me move forward. As soon as the game was working I created a GIT branch and started to change the images and the array. As I changed the array I also had to make other changes in the code to get the right values in the right places. This took me a while and I had to test and correct several errors. During this project I learned to systematically use console.log() to see if the code snippet I just wrote was working. This helped me a lot.
